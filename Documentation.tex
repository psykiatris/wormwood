\section{Introduction}
It's 1987: graphics haven't even been invented yet. You spend your nights sneaking into the local university computer lab to play text-adventure games on the latest hardware. 

It's 2009: You can play text adventures on your brand-new quad-core gaming PC. 

Wormwood. Wormwood. Wormwood.

\section{Structure of the Source Code}
Wormwood is written with extensibility in mind. The way it's set up was semi-planned, and it seems to work alright. I don't know a whole lot about designing large programs. The fact that new features are easy enough to add right now makes it seem like I made at least \textit{some} good choices when I was laying things out.
